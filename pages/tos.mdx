By accessing the Site, you acknowledge and agree to these Terms, including any Services Agreement incorporated here. If you disagree, you must stop using the Site immediately.

Supplemental terms may be added to the Site and are included by reference. We may update these Terms at our discretion and will indicate any changes with a revised "Last updated" date. By continuing to use the Site after updates, you accept the changes. Check the Terms regularly to stay informed.

The Siteâ€™s content is not for distribution in areas where it's illegal or requires us to register. Accessing the Site from other locations is at your own risk, and you must comply with local laws.

## 1. Intelectual Property Rights

1. The Site is owned by us, including all code, databases, functions, designs, audio, video, text, images, and trademarks ("Content" and "Marks"). These are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws. The Content and Marks are for personal use only and cannot be used commercially without our written consent.

2. If you're allowed to use the Site, you get a limited license to view and download Content for non-commercial purposes. We retain all rights not explicitly given to you regarding the Site, Content, and Marks.

## 2. Service Availability

Our website and its associated services are typically accessible around the clock. However, there may be disruptions due to scheduled maintenance or unexpected incidents. It is technically unfeasible to guarantee the website's perfect functionality at all times, thus we cannot be held accountable for any defects or errors.

We endeavor to ensure that your data, including files from our services, is consistently stored and retrievable whenever needed. Nonetheless, there may be instances of transmission, storage, retrieval, or operational failures that could lead to the partial or complete loss of data. We disclaim any responsibility for data loss or any related damages. You must back up your data using the tools we provide.

Moreover, the website's accessibility is contingent on factors and advantages that are outside our control, such as your internet service. We cannot be held liable for disruptions stemming from these external conditions.

## 3. Free tier limitations

1. You are required to use our services only as intended, abiding by all relevant laws. Misusing services or bypassing any technical safeguards or usage limits is forbidden. Excessive demands on our resources should be avoided, and we may terminate your account and delete all related data if these terms are breached.

2. Servers with no activity for more than 7 days will be deleted automatically.

3. Our free tier necessitates certain limitations and restrictions to maintain system integrity, equitable user treatment, and optimal security. Bypassing these controls is strictly forbidden, specifically:

- Automating access to or actions on our website. (For example: Using an automated action to bypass the renewal timer.)
- Uploading external executable files.
- Uploading malicious files.
- Commercial use of our services is not allowed, except for creating and commercially exploiting media content like videos.
- Overusing our resources is prohibited.

4. Violating these terms may lead to account and data deletion or suspension. Once suspended, you cannot access your account, servers, or data, and all server data is permanently removed after 7 days of suspension. Serious violations, such as cyber-attacks, fraud, or other criminal actions, may be reported to law enforcement.

## 4. Termination

1. These Terms of Use are effective while you engage with the Site. We hold the right, at our sole discretion and without any obligation to notify or bear liability, to restrict access to the Site (this may include IP address bans) to anyone for any reason, or even without a specific reason, particularly if there's a violation of any terms, warranties, or laws applicable. We may also end your access or participation in the Site or remove your account.

2. Should your account be suspended or terminated, you are forbidden from creating a new account under your own name, a false name, or the name of another individual, even if you are representing that individual. Beyond account suspension or termination, we may pursue legal measures, including but not limited to civil, criminal, and injunctive relief.
